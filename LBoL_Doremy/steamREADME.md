[h1][b]Doremy Character Mod (Public Beta)[/b][/h1]

Adds Doremy Sweet as a playable character to Lost branch of Legend.

[h1][b]Overview:[/b][/h1]

Thank you for your participation in the Doremy Sweet Public Beta\! Your feedback will help us polish our mod and refine our balancing so that the full release of Doremy can be as high quality as possible; if you choose to give it. If not, then I hope you enjoy playing this early version of the character while we work on finishing the final version\! The mod currently contains:

- 1 Player Character and her Shining Exhibits (colors: White, Blue)  
- 69 Cards, not including Tokens  
-  A UI indicator for cards which were created mid-combat  
-  A lot of highly WIP card art, please wait warmly for me to draw propper art for each card, or if you’re so inclined, I’d appreciate any artistic help offered to me at “@GameCavalier” in the LBoL Discord server\!

[h1]This mod uses [i]NoMoreMetaScaling[/i] as [i]optional[/i] dependency. [/h1]

As Doremy is card gen heavy character indefinite resource generation could shift her gameplay experience wildly. [b]Disable it if you don't want it.[/b]

[h1][b]Main Themes:[/b][/h1]

[i]Card Generation[/i] (White): As the Ruler of Dreams, Doremy is capable of creating Dreams in the form of cards to supplement and improve her deck mid-battle. While dreams are fickle and unpredictable in nature, and thus less reliable than the cards physically in your deck, the expanded options they grant and their potential to conjure powerful rare cards should more than make up for the inconsistency. If random cards aren’t your speed, however, there are many more ways to generate a card mid-combat; as such, Doremy has access to plentiful card copying effects and a wide variety of cheap tokens to act as consistent keystones for your deck.

[i]Dream Layers[/i] (Blue): True to her vanilla elite encounter, Doremy gains power the deeper she plunges into dream. She does this via her unique Dreamlayer keyword, which can be found organically on some cards or granted to any card by others. Unplayed cards with Dreamlayer will gain power and return to the Draw Pile at the end of your turn, increasing their base stats each time they do. While this repeated reshuffling will slow down your draw velocity and overall gameplan considerably; with enough investment, Doremy can refine her best cards into massive powerhouses with unmatched value per play.

[i]Nightmare[/i] (Both): Although far less involved than Doremy’s other main themes, Nightmare is a common sight in Doremy’s cardpool; serving as an alternative damage source which bypasses almost all defensive effects, simply striking your targets down on the spot should their Nightmare level ever met or exceed their current life.


[h1][b]Gameplay notes:[/b][/h1]

- Doremy lacks Graze cards entirely, but has more Barrier to compensate, hard to dodge in your sleep after all.  
- Although Nightmare is a status, it can and often should be treated as just plain damage. You can refer to Nightmare’s status icon for information on the [i]effective[/i] remaining life of your foes.  
- Doremy can make highly effective use of Spirit through cards which give block or barrier multiple times, or with Dreamlayer.  
- Enemies creating status cards is still creating cards; a fact Doremy can take full advantage of.  
- Slow and Steady wins the race; Doremy is well suited to more defensive playstyles.

[h1][b]Additional Notes:[/b][/h1]

A mod co-developed by Neoshrimp and GameCavalier.

Please provide balancing and gameplay feedback, along with bug reports, to either [b]@GameCavalier or @Neoshrimp in the #mod-discuss[/b] page on the Lost Branch of Legend Discord server. 

Self Nightmare, as a mechanic, is highly experimental; feedback here is especially valuable, both on balance and also just if you like the idea or not behind each card or not. Thank you for any feedback you choose to give\!

TODO: Draw propper art of decent quality for all cards, create a Doremy Sweet Act 1 boss for other characters and Eiki.

[h1][b]Special Thanks:[/b][/h1]

[h1][b]Cavalier’s Thanks:[/b][/h1]

- Special thanks to all the members of the LBoL discord server who participated in convincing me to undertake this project in the first place, it literally wouldn’t exist without you\!  
- Special thanks to Neoshrimp for doing all of the coding, not only did you save me many headaches in learning to code from scratch, but your expertise has also enabled me to include things in Doremy which I previously considered well outside my scope\!  
- Special thanks to many members of the LBoL discord server who provided feedback on my original Doremy Spreadsheet, including but far from limited to Saevin\_7, Lvalon, and PepperOni.
